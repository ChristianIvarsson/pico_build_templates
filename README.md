# Grew tired of rewriting these..

# 1. Place contents of build_pico or build_pico2 inside your build dir, edit them according to project needs.
# 2. Pick appropriate CMakeLists_*.txt and place it inside your project dir as CMakeLists.txt, edit accordingly.
# 3. Copy pico_sdk_import.cmake to the same location.
# 4. Read howto_build.txt

# NOTES
# ramload is not working on rp2350-based boards. Not sure if it's a openocd problem or if more init stuff is needed
